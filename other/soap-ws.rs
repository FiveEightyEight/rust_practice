/*
    It is possible to implement a SOAP server using the Rust programming language. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol 
    for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.

    To implement a SOAP server in Rust, you can use a library such as ws-rs, which provides support for the WebSockets protocol
    used in many SOAP implementations.

    Here is an example of how you might implement a simple SOAP server in Rust using the ws-rs library:
*/

extern crate ws;

use ws::{listen, CloseCode, Result, Handler, Sender, Handshake};

struct Server {
    out: Sender,
}

impl Handler for Server {
    fn on_open(&mut self, _: Handshake) -> Result<()> {
        // We have a new connection, so we send a message to the client to welcome them
        self.out.send("Hello, client! This is a SOAP server implemented in Rust.")
    }

    fn on_message(&mut self, msg: ws::Message) -> Result<()> {
        // Print the message to the console
        println!("Received message: {}", msg);

        // Echo the message back to the client
        self.out.send(msg)
    }

    fn on_close(&mut self, code: CloseCode, reason: &str) {
        match code {
            CloseCode::Normal => println!("The client is done with the connection."),
            CloseCode::Away   => println!("The client is leaving the site."),
            _ => println!("The client encountered an error: {}", reason),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Bind the server to port 9999
    listen("127.0.0.1:9999", |out| Server { out }).unwrap()
}

/*
    This example creates a simple SOAP server that listens for incoming connections on port 9999, and sends a greeting message to the client when a connection is established.
    It also echoes any messages received from the client back to the client.

    Of course, a real-world SOAP server would likely have more sophisticated functionality, but this example illustrates the basic principles of implementing a SOAP server using Rust.
